I&#39;ve tried best practices in design and development process as they have emerged from the leaders in the object-oriented development community. Some of my projects were very successful; a few failed. A feature common to the successes was a rich domain model that evolved through iterations of design and became part of the fabric of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book provides a framework for making design decisions and a technical vocabulary for discussing domain design.

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called &ldquo;Divide-and-Conquer&rdquo;), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.

(43, 'Ask HN: Does Anybody Still Use JQuery?', '<h3>Lorem Ipsum: when, and when not to use it</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you like Cheese Whiz? Spray tan? Fake eyelashes? That&#39;s what is Lorem Ipsum to many&mdash;it rubs them the wrong way, all the way. It&#39;s unreal, uncanny, makes you wonder if something is wrong, it seems to seek your attention for all the wrong reasons. Usually, we prefer the real thing, wine without sulfur based preservatives, real butter, not margarine, and so we&#39;d like our layouts and designs to be filled with real words, with thoughts that count, information that has value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toppings you may chose for that TV dinner pizza slice when you forgot to shop for foods, the paint you may slap on your face to impress the new boss is your business. But what about your daily bread? Design comps, layouts, wireframes&mdash;will your clients accept that you go about things the facile way? Authorities in our business will tell in no uncertain terms that Lorem Ipsum is that huge, huge no no to forswear forever. Not so fast, I&#39;d say, there are some redeeming factors in favor of greeking text, as its use is merely the symptom of a worse problem to take into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost/blog/webmag/img/post-4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Lorem Ipsum is bad (not necessarily)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You begin with a text, you sculpt information, you chisel away what&#39;s not needed, you come to the point, make things clear, add value, you&#39;re a content person, you like words. Design is no afterthought, far from it, but it comes in a deserved second. Anyway, you still use Lorem Ipsum and rightly so, as it will always have a place in the web workers toolbox, as things happen, not always the way you like it, not always in the preferred order. Even if your less into design and more into content strategy you may find some redeeming value with, wait for it, dummy copy, no less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s lot of hate out there for a text that amounts to little more than garbled words in an old language. The villagers are out there with a vengeance to get that Frankenstein, wielding torches and pitchforks, wanting to tar and feather it at the least, running it out of town in shame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the villagers, Kristina Halvorson from Adaptive Path, holds steadfastly to the notion that design can&rsquo;t be tested without real content:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I&rsquo;ve heard the argument that &ldquo;lorem ipsum&rdquo; is effective in wireframing or design because it helps people focus on the actual layout, or color scheme, or whatever. What kills me here is that we&rsquo;re talking about creating a user experience that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow is FOR THE WORDS.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If that&#39;s what you think how bout the other way around? How can you evaluate content without design? No typography, no colors, no layout, no styles, all those things that convey the important signals that go beyond the mere textual, hierarchies of information, weight, emphasis, oblique stresses, priorities, all those subtle cues that also have visual and emotional appeal to the reader. Rigid proponents of content strategy may shun the use of dummy copy but then designers might want to ask them to provide style sheets with the copy decks they supply that are in tune with the design direction they require.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Summing up, if the copy is diverting attention from the design it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not up to task.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Typographers of yore didn&#39;t come up with the concept of dummy copy because people thought that content is inconsequential window dressing, only there to be used by designers who can&rsquo;t be bothered to read. Lorem Ipsum is needed because words matter, a lot. Just fill up a page with draft copy about the client&rsquo;s business and they will actually read it and comment on it. They will be drawn to it, fiercely. Do it the wrong way and draft copy can derail your design review.</p>\r\n', 'post-page.jpg', '2021-08-25 16:11:14', 4, 15);

This allows you to quickly see all the changes done to the project, without having merge commits cluttering the git history.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$git log --no-merges\r\n\r\ncommit e75fe8bf2c5c46dbd9e1bc20d2f8b2ede81f2d93\r\nAuthor:  John\r\nDate:   Mon Jul 10 18:04:50 2017 +0300\r\n\r\n    Add new branch.\r\n\r\ncommit 080dfd342ab0dbdf69858e3b01e18584d4eade34\r\nAuthor:  John\r\nDate:   Mon Jul 11 15:40:56 2017 +0300\r\n\r\n    Added index.php.\r\n\r\ncommit 2965803c0deeac1f2427ec2f5394493ed4211655\r\nAuthor:  John\r\nDate:   Mon Jul 13 12:14:50 2017 +0300\r\n\r\n    Added css files.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert#git-revert--n\" target=\"_blank\">git revert --no-commit [commit]</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Git revert generates a new commit that undoes the changes made by existing commits and generates a new commit with the resulting content. If you want to to revert the named commits and avoid the automatic commits, you can use the flag --no-commit or the shorthand -n.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#git-diff--w\" target=\"_blank\">git diff -w</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><code>Git diff</code>&nbsp;shows the changes between two commits, two working trees or two files on disk. When multiple people work on the same project, often there are changes due to text editor&#39;s tab and space setting. In order to ignore differences caused by whitespaces when comparing lines, you can use it with the -w flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#git-diff---statltwidthgtltname-widthgtltcountgt\" target=\"_blank\">git diff --stat</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Shows how each file has been changed over time. You can add 3 parameters:&nbsp;<strong>width</strong>&nbsp;to override the default output width,&nbsp;<strong>name-width</strong>&nbsp;to set the width of the filename and&nbsp;<strong>count</strong>&nbsp;to limit the output to the first number of lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ git diff --stat\r\n index.php | 83 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++---------------------------\r\n 1 file changed, 43 insertions(+), 40 deletions(-)\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ git diff --stat-width=10\r\n index.php | 83 +++---\r\n 1 file changed, 43 insertions(+), 40 deletions(-)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#git-reset---soft\" target=\"_blank\">git reset --soft HEAD^</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Reset the head to a certain commit without touching the index file and the working tree. All changes made after this commit are moved to &quot;staged for commit&quot; stage. After that you just need to run&nbsp;<code>git commit</code>&nbsp;to add them back in.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash#git-stash-branchltbranchnamegtltstashgt\" target=\"_blank\">git stash branch [branch-name] [stash]</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This command creates a new branch named branch-name and check it out, then applies the changes from the given stash to it and drops the stash. If no stash is given, it uses the latest one. This allows you to apply any stashed changes into a safer environment, that can later be merged into master.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch#git-branch--a\" target=\"_blank\">git branch -a</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It shows a list of all remote-tracking and local branches. You can use the --merged flag to see only the branches that are fully merged to the master branch. This way you can track your branches and find out which ones aren&#39;t used anymore and can be deleted.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ git branch -a\r\n\r\n  dev\r\n* master\r\n  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master\r\n  remotes/origin/dev\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#git-commit---amend\" target=\"_blank\">git commit --amend</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With&nbsp;<code>git commit --amend</code>&nbsp;you can change your previous commit, instead of making a new one. If you haven&#39;t pushed your changes to a remote branch, you can use this command to amend the most recent commit, adding your latest changes and even changing your commit message.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull#git-pull---rebasefalsetruepreserveinteractive\" target=\"_blank\">git pull --rebase</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Git pull --rebase forces git to first pull the changes and then rebase the unpushed commits on top of the latest version of the remote branch. The --rebase option can be used to ensure a linear history by preventing unnecessary merge commits.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#git-add--p\" target=\"_blank\">git add -p</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you use this command, instead of immediately adding all the changed to the index, it goes through each change and asks what you want to do with it. This way, it allows you to interactively choose exactly what you want to be committed.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ndiff --git a/package.json b/package.json\r\nindex db78332..a814f7e 100644\r\n--- a/package.json\r\n+++ b/package.json\r\n@@ -6,7 +6,6 @@\r\n   },\r\n   &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\r\n     &quot;bootstrap-sass&quot;: &quot;^3.3.7&quot;,\r\n-    &quot;gulp&quot;: &quot;^3.9.1&quot;,\r\n     &quot;jquery&quot;: &quot;^3.1.0&quot;,\r\n     &quot;laravel-elixir&quot;: &quot;^6.0.0-11&quot;,\r\n     &quot;laravel-elixir-vue-2&quot;: &quot;^0.2.0&quot;,\r\nStage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,e,?]? </pre>\r\n', '10-useful-git-tips.png', '2021-04-13 16:45:08', 16, 15),

The main goal of Placement Cell is to provide the best training on aptitude, resume building, group discussion, technical training and interview skills. The Placement Cell also plays a crucial role in suitably placing the alumni whenever required. The Placement Committee members at the department level execute the training plan after assessing the core competencies of the students. They constantly track the students&rsquo; performance to ensure improvement through periodic assessment tests/psychometric tests. These periodic assessment tests aid students to identify their areas of strength they can upgrade, and their areas of improvement which they can focus on. The Placement Committee also focuses on student internships for them to get hands-on experience, improve leadership skills, gain knowledge on specific industries and their operations. A few leading organizations that hire SCC&rsquo;s graduates are Legato Healthcare Technology; SLK Software; Gallagher; Cognizant; DXC Technology; L&amp;T Infotech; Accenture; Amazon; Deloitte; Capgemini; ICICI Bank; Yes Bank; Axis Bank; HDFC Bank; Tech Mahindra; Clear Tax; PWC; Morgan Stanley; JP Morgan; EY; KPMG; and Genpact.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Extension Activities[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St._Claret_College&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\">edit</a>]</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning to serve is an integral part of the Claretian education and it forms one of the core values of SCC. To realize this mission, the college has included village adoption, training and awareness programs, seminars and workshops on social issues, and it also conducts awareness rallies as a mandatory part of the education.
